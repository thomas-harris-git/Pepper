Description: I designed and developed the first prototype of a robo receptionist for the computer science department. I used a humanoid robot called “Pepper” and developed a conative system for it involving speech perception/recognition as well as the ability to learn new information through natural human interaction. The system also included several other tasks that Pepper could complete such as, ordering a taxi, providing the most popular movie and more general information including the weather forecast.
